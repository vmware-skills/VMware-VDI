# VMware VDI (Horizon)

For a read-only check of this skill with your model and agent host, use the shared [model-fit self-test](https://github.com/vmware-skills/marketplace/blob/main/MODEL_FIT_SELF_TEST.md) in the marketplace root.

**AI-powered intelligent operations for VMware / Omnissa Horizon VDI** — manage desktop pools, RDS farms,
published apps, **user sessions**, desktop machines, entitlements, instant-clone images, and Horizon
events/health/statistics through the **Horizon 8 Connection Server REST API**. Ships as both an **MCP
server** (for AI agents) and a **CLI** (for help-desk and scripting). Part of the
[VMware skill family](#companion-skills).

## Upgrading to 2.0

2.0 renames all 27 MCP tools so every name starts with a verb (e.g. `ad_user_search` → `search_ad_users`, `app_pool_list` → `list_app_pools`, `entitlement_add` → `add_entitlement`). The full old → new table is in
[RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md#v200--mcp-tools-renamed-verb-first). Nothing else changes: same tools, parameters,
safety gates and CLI commands. If an agent prompt, script or `~/.vmware/rules.yaml` names a tool, update it — though deny
rules written with the old names keep working with vmware-policy ≥ 1.18 (`vmware-audit policy` lists any rule the
renames widened), and vmware-pilot ≥ 1.13 translates old names in saved workflows.
If an install older than 2.0 shares that `rules.yaml`, give it vmware-policy ≥ 1.18.2 too: it matches each rule
against both the old and the new name, so one file serves both.

## Why vmware-vdi

Every other VMware family skill stops at the vСenter VM. **A Horizon desktop pool sits *on* those VMs** —
so `vmware-aiops` can reset the backing VM, but it cannot see a *user session*, log a user off, disable a
*pool*, or push a golden image. `vmware-vdi` fills exactly that day-2 VDI gap — "who is stuck on a broken
desktop", "log this user off so their profile unlocks", "why is this pool not provisioning", "push the
patched image to Finance tonight" — with the family's **governed-ops harness**: every write is audited,
previews its blast radius, and is authorized by the Horizon account's own RBAC role.

## Capabilities — 27 MCP tools (16 read / 11 write)

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Monitoring** | health summary · session list/get · machine list/get · event list |
| **Statistics** | session concurrency stats · per-pool utilization |
| **Management** | pool list/get · farm list · app-pool list · entitlement list · image list · AD search · pool enable/disable · entitlement add/remove |
| **Ops actions** | session logoff / disconnect / message · machine reset / maintenance / remove |
| **Tasks** | task status · **image push** · task cancel |

Reads are strictly non-destructive. Writes **preview their blast radius**, double-confirm at the CLI, and
are audit-logged to `~/.vmware/audit.db`. `push_desktop_pool_image` recreates *every desktop in a pool* — the
highest single-call blast radius in the family — and its preview states affected-desktop and
in-session counts before any confirm, together with `occupancy`: `determined` when those counts
can be believed, `unknown` when sessions exist that cannot be attributed to any pool or farm. An
`unknown` occupancy refuses the confirm rather than reporting an unverified zero; overriding it
needs `--acknowledge-unknown-occupancy` and is recorded in the audit row. A machine that names no
desktop pool also makes the desktop count a lower bound ("at least N"); that refuses the confirm
with no override.

On MCP, every gated write takes `confirm` (default `false`). A call without it returns `blast_radius` —
the object's identity, counts, identifiers up to 20, `blockers` and `unmeasured` — and changes nothing;
the acting response carries the same dict. An agent should show it to the user and pass `confirm=true`
only after they agree. When something the blast radius depends on could not be read — a machine's
state, a session's user, a task's type or state, a pool's enabled flag, a pool's current entitlements —
`confirm=true` is refused with a message naming what to check.

## Quick start

```bash
uv tool install vmware-vdi
vmware-vdi init      # friendly wizard: connect to a Connection Server + discover your pools
vmware-vdi doctor    # verify config / credentials / connectivity
vmware-vdi health    # one-glance VDI health
```

`vmware-vdi init` prompts for the Connection Server host, admin username, AD domain, and password; writes
`~/.vmware-vdi/config.yaml` + a `0600` `.env` (password obfuscated); tests the login; and on success
**discovers your pools, machines, and sessions** with the next commands to try.

## Example workflows

**Help-desk — a user's desktop is stuck**
```bash
vmware-vdi session list --user alice
vmware-vdi machine list --state AGENT_UNREACHABLE
vmware-vdi session logoff --user alice --dry-run   # preview which sessions
vmware-vdi session logoff --user alice             # double-confirm, then logs off + audits
```

**Patch night — push a new golden image**
```bash
vmware-vdi image list
vmware-vdi pool push-image --id pool-fin --dry-run  # BLAST RADIUS: N desktops, M logged-in users
vmware-vdi pool push-image --id pool-fin            # double-confirm; returns a task
vmware-vdi task status --pool pool-fin              # track progress
```

## MCP server

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vmware-vdi": {
      "command": "vmware-vdi",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": { "VMWARE_VDI_CONFIG": "~/.vmware-vdi/config.yaml" }
    }
  }
}
```
Using the installed `vmware-vdi mcp` console script (not `uvx`) avoids a PyPI re-resolve on every launch —
important behind enterprise TLS proxies.

## Supported versions

- **VMware Horizon 8.x** (primary) — Connection Server REST API `/rest/v1`.
- **Latest Omnissa Horizon** (2406 / 2412+) — same `/rest/v1` lineage.

## Security

- **Authorization = Horizon RBAC.** The skill does not gate read vs write; point a target at a **read-only
  Horizon admin role** and every write is refused at the Connection Server, un-bypassably.
- **Credentials** live only in `~/.vmware-vdi/.env` (`0600`, obfuscated `b64:` at rest); config files hold
  host/username/domain only. Inject `VMWARE_VDI_<TARGET>_PASSWORD` from a secret manager for real secrecy.
- **TLS** verification on by default. All Connection-Server text is `sanitize()`d against prompt injection.
- **No outbound calls** except to the configured Connection Server — no webhooks, no telemetry.

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and `skills/vmware-vdi/references/setup-guide.md`.

## Beta note

REST **endpoints** are verified against the official Horizon Server API operation index. GET-response
**field names** (and a few write bodies) are defensive (`.get()` with fallbacks) and **pending validation
against a live Connection Server**. On a field-name mismatch a list reads empty rather than crashing.
First real-Horizon use should run `vmware-vdi init` and confirm the session/machine/pool projections;
please [file an issue](https://github.com/vmware-skills/VMware-VDI/issues) with raw `*_get` output if a projection
looks empty. Quality: 32 regression tests, ruff clean, bandit 0, tool endpoints pinned to a verified spec.

<!-- usage: remote-and-exposure -->
## Remote access (HTTPS) and limiting tools

By default `vmware-vdi mcp` speaks stdio to one local client and offers every tool. Two options change that
(vmware-policy ≥ 1.21.0).

**Serve over HTTPS** so clients on other machines can connect. Every caller needs a bearer token:

```bash
vmware-audit token create alice          # prints the token once; give it to alice
vmware-audit token list                  # names only
vmware-audit token revoke alice          # refused from its next request, no restart
vmware-vdi mcp --transport https --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8443 \
    --cert /etc/vmware-mcp/server.pem --key /etc/vmware-mcp/server-key.pem \
    --public-name mcp.example.com
```

Connect a client (Claude Code shown; any MCP client that supports streamable HTTP and custom headers works):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http vmware-vdi https://mcp.example.com:8443/mcp \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $VMWARE_MCP_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vmware-vdi": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com:8443/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${VMWARE_MCP_TOKEN}" }
    }
  }
}
```

- The server will not start without a token, refuses Host/Origin values outside `--public-name`, and checks
  before it binds that unauthenticated requests get 401. Use a certificate your clients trust for those names.
- Behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy on the same machine use `--transport http --host 127.0.0.1
  --public-name mcp.example.com` and pass the `Authorization` header through.
- Behind a load balancer or gateway on another machine, keep `--transport https` (a self-signed certificate is
  fine), list in `--public-name` the host name the balancer sends as `Host`, and have it forward `Authorization`.
  Its health probe can use `GET /healthz`, which needs no token and returns only `{"status": "ok"}`
  (vmware-policy ≥ 1.23.0).
- Send `traceparent` or `X-Request-ID` with each request to have it stored on the audit row;
  `vmware-audit log --correlation-id ID` then finds the calls behind one platform request.
- The audit log records each caller as `token:<name>`. Calls run side by side, with or without a target: each
  target keeps up to `VMWARE_MCP_POOL_SIZE` sessions (default 2), and each session is a login on the target. A call
  that finds them all busy waits at most 300 s for one.
- **Everyone who can reach the endpoint acts with this server's account.** Tokens identify callers; they grant
  nothing on the platform. Run one endpoint per privilege level.
- **Several people or roles on one endpoint:** run `vmware-audit roles enable` once, then give each token a role (`vmware-audit token create NAME --role reader`, or a role in `roles.yaml` naming tools and targets; vmware-policy ≥ 1.24.0). A role limits what the token may call on this endpoint; it cannot grant more than the account has. See vmware-policy's README, "Roles for network callers".

**Offer only read tools, plus the writes you choose:**

```bash
vmware-vdi mcp --expose read --allow-write add_entitlement
# or: VMWARE_VDI_MCP_EXPOSE=read VMWARE_VDI_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE=add_entitlement vmware-vdi mcp
```

Tools not offered do not appear in the client's tool list. A bad value or an unknown write tool stops the server
(exit 2). This limits what clients are offered; it is not authorization, so the account itself should be
least-privilege.
