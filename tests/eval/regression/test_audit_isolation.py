"""The test suite must never write to the operator's real audit trail.

Real-hardware finding, 2026-08-30 (VCF 9.1): running ``pytest`` appended rows to
the operator's live ``~/.vmware/audit.db``. The sibling repo VMware-VKS had the
same leak with louder evidence — a ``delete_tkc_cluster {"confirmed": true}``
row for a cluster that never existed on any vCenter.

That is wrong twice. It corrupts the operator's own record of what was done to
their estate, and it means a compliance artefact — the file that answers "who
changed this host's iSCSI configuration" — contains fiction that a reader cannot
tell from fact.

The fix is a sandbox installed in ``tests/conftest.py`` *at import time*, before
``vmware_vdi`` is imported: ``HOME`` and ``OPS_HOME`` both point into a
temporary directory. The tests below are the assertion half — a future test that
forgets to isolate itself cannot reach the real file, because there is no code
path from the sandboxed environment to it.

Both halves are needed. ``OPS_HOME`` covers the shared ``vmware_policy``
database; it does *not* cover ``vmware_vdi.notify.audit.AuditLogger``, whose
default path is the ``~``-relative string ``~/.vmware-vdi/audit.log`` and
which is constructed at ``cli`` / ``mcp_server.server`` import.
