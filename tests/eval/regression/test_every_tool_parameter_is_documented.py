"""Regression: every MCP tool parameter carries a Google-style ``Args:`` entry.

Why this exists
---------------
The JSON schema is the only part of a tool an agent can actually read. Prose in
the docstring body explains the tool; it says nothing about a *parameter*. A
measurement across the family's 327 tools found ``description`` coverage on
parameter schemas at 0% — every word of guidance was in prose the schema never
carried — and this skill's ``machine_get`` and ``pool_get`` were among them — both taking an
opaque Horizon id that is neither the display name nor the vCenter VM name,
with nothing in the schema to say so.

The failure that produces is silent twice over. Guess a parameter name wrong
and the extra key is discarded, so a filtered query quietly returns the
unfiltered set. Guess a *value* wrong — ``aggregation="count()"`` where the
appliance wants ``COUNT`` — and you get an error or an empty series where there
was data. Neither looks like a mistake from the outside.

The family is landing a shared helper that copies each parameter's ``Args:``
entry into the schema at registration time. That helper can only copy text that
exists, so this test guards the input side: it fails the moment a tool grows a
parameter nobody described.

Not a style check
-----------------
It also refuses a description that only restates the name (``target: The
target.``). That is worse than an absent one: it fills the slot, so the gap
stops being visible while the agent still learns nothing.

形态 #1 — the check must not pass vacuously. If the registry hands back no
tools, or no tool has parameters, that is this test being broken rather than
this skill being clean, and it fails saying so.
